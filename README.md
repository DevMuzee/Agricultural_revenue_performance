# 📊 Agricultural Sales Performance Dashboard

## 🌾 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive sales performance analysis of agricultural products using a custom-excel-built dashboard. 
The goal is to evaluate how effectively various agricultural products performed in terms of revenue generation, cost-efficiency, and market potential from 2022 to 2023. 
The dashboard offers valuable insights for stakeholders such as suppliers, farm managers, and agribusiness analysts to identify high-performing products, 
understand quarterly trends, and optimize inventory and sales strategies.
